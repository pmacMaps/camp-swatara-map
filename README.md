# Camp Swatara Web Map
This repository serves to provide a demo of what a web map of the hiking trails at [Camp Swatara](https://www.campswatara.org/) could look like.  Based upon lack of communication, this project may be dormat.

I'm using Parcel.js to build the web map.  I have also decided to create it using two different APIS: Leaflet.js and Esri JS API.  The `main` branch uses Leaflet.js, and the [esri-api-parcel](https://github.com/pmacMaps/camp-swatara-map/tree/esri-api-parcel) branch uses Esri JS API.
