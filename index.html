        <h1>Camp Swatara Hiking Trails Map</h1>
        <p>Below, are links to two versions of an interactive webmap of hiking trails at Camp Swatara.  One was built with Leaflet.js, and the other with the ArcGIS JavaScript API.  View the <a href="https://github.com/pmacMaps/camp-swatara-map">project on GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>There are plans to eventually create this simple map using Mapbox.js and Google Maps API.  My goal is to have a repository that can show how the same map app is built using the major web mapping JavaScript libraries.</p>
